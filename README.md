## local

run

```sh
docker-compose up
```

## Installation

The simplest way to set up snarkov is using [Heroku][he]. Just press this button to deploy it:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

You'll need to set up a Slack [outgoing webhook][ow] to send messages to snarkov. Set it up so it listens to a single channel of your choice, _don't_ set up a keyword. Copy the integration's token, you'll need it to deploy the app. You'll also need a Slack API token. You can get one by going to [this page][token] while logged into Slack. Once you have everything in place, deploy the app, then set the outgoing webhook's url to `https://[your-heroku-app].herokuapp.com/markov`, and save it.

## Importing channels

Snarkov works better if it has a lot of text to work with. To help populate it, you can feed it the entire history of a list of Slack channels. **Warning:** Depending on how many messages are in the channel's history, this might take a long time, and potentially fill up your free Heroku Redis account very quickly. You'll probably want to go to your Heroku dashboard and upgrade your Redis plan to one of the paid levels before doing this, or use the `DAYS` option to limit the amount of text you're importing.

To populate redis in production, install the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com) and run:

```
$ heroku run rake ingest CHANNELS='#channel-name' --app your-heroku-app-name
```

The `ingest` task takes a single channel name, or a comma-separated list of channel names, e.g.:

```
$ heroku run rake ingest CHANNELS='#random,#general' --app your-heroku-app-name
```

If you want to import a channel's history going back only a certain number of days, you can add a `DAYS` option. For example:

```
$ heroku run rake ingest CHANNELS='#random,#general' DAYS=5 --app your-heroku-app-name
```

This will import the last 5 days of chat history from the #random and #general channels.

If you only want to import a certain user's messages, use the `USERNAME` option. For example:

```
$ heroku run rake ingest CHANNELS='#random,#general' USERNAME="guille" --app your-heroku-app-name
```

## Usage

After snarkov is up and running, the outgoing webhook you set up will send every message in the channel you selected (except those from other integrations) to snarkov, which will process and store it for future usage. It might respond with a Markov-generated message of its own, depending on the number you have set in the `RESPONSE_CHANCE` environment variable, with 0 meaning it will never respond, and 1 meaning it'll respond every single time.

If you have a Mac, a fun thing to do is run this in the terminal:

```
$ curl -s http://[your-heroku-app]/markov?token=[outgoing-webhook-token] | say -i
```

## Running locally

1. Install redis
2. Create a `.env` file and put the config variables there (see `.env.example`)
3. Run `bundle install`
4. Run `foreman start -f Procfile.dev`
5. Send POST requests to `http://localhost:5000/markov` to populate it, with the `text` parameter being the message's text, and `token` the outgoing webhook's token.
6. Send GET requests to `http://localhost:5000/markov?token=[OUTGOING_WEBHOOK_TOKEN]` to see a random reply
